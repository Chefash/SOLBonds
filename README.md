SOLBonds

Find your NFT SOLmate. Earn USDC while being cute.

SOLBonds is a matching protocol on Solana where two NFTs pair up, bond, and generate yield together. Love, but make it productive.

🚀 What It Does

Mint your SOLBond for 5 USDC

Fill out your profile (zodiac, pets, risk vibes)

Get matched with someone you actually like

Accept the match → form a Bond

Earn real USDC from the shared pool

Break up anytime (for a price… as it should be)

💸 How You Earn

Rewards scale with:

Compatibility score (higher = juicier multipliers)

Bond duration (stay loyal, get paid)

Pool growth (Kamino 24% APY powering everything)

Examples?
A high-compatibility pair can print some seriously disrespectful APY.
